## Blackjack Simulator & Strategy Profile
This project proposes a model for sequential betting in repeated games of Blackjack. We establish the rational behavior of gamblers provided standard betting rules and information, and consider a single gambler that receives information as it occurs. For simplicity, we assume the gambler is rationale i.e., the bet size and strategy are determined by existing optimal play charts. 

We first establish the structure of the game, programming the rules and betting policy. This policy determines, given a realization of the current action, how much of the initial funds will be bet, so that the long-term average profit is maximized. When optimizing, we will simulate successive hands across players and sub-strategies.
